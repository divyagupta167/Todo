ToDo App 
Description
This is a simple ToDo App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks with their respective due dates and descriptions. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage to persist data across sessions.

Features
Add New Task: Click on "Add new Task" to open a modal form where you can enter the details for a new task, including task title, due date, and description. The app performs basic form validation to ensure that the task title is not left blank.

View Tasks: All the added tasks are displayed in the app interface. Each task shows the title, due date, and description.

Edit Task: You can edit an existing task by clicking on the edit icon (pencil) next to the task. The task details will be populated in the form, and you can modify the title, due date, and description. Click "Add" after making changes to save the edited task.

Delete Task: To remove a task from the list, click on the delete icon (trash can) next to the task.

Data Persistence: The app uses localStorage to store the tasks, ensuring that your tasks remain available even after closing the app or refreshing the page.

Installation
To use this ToDo App, you don't need to install anything. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser, and the app will be ready to use.

How to Use
Open the app by opening the index.html file in your web browser.

To add a new task, click on "Add new Task." A modal form will appear, where you can fill in the task details.

Enter the title of the task, the due date, and a description (optional).

Click "Add" to save the task, or "Close" to dismiss the form.

All added tasks will be displayed below the "Tasks" heading.

To edit a task, click on the edit icon (pencil) next to the task. The task details will be pre-filled in the form, allowing you to make changes. Click "Add" to save the edited task.

To delete a task, click on the delete icon (trash can) next to the task.

Notes
The app uses Bootstrap for styling and layout.

The app also uses Font Awesome icons for the "Add new Task," "Edit," and "Delete" actions.

The main.js file contains the JavaScript code for handling form submissions, performing validation, and managing task data.

The style.css file contains custom CSS styles for the app's appearance.

The app relies on localStorage for data storage, so clearing your browser's data may result in the loss of tasks.

Compatibility
The ToDo App has been tested and should work on modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
